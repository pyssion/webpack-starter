- [x] Redux and reselect
- [ ] Rx.js for side effects
- [x] future ready CSS
- [x] configurable eslint
- [x] webpack based with HMR

## TODO

- [x] react, react-router, redux and their children
- [ ] Rx.js and more
- [x] CSS stuff
- [x] eslint configuration
- [ ] webpack loaders and plugins
- [x] babel syntax preference
- [ ] standard components, containers, etc
- [ ] templates and code generation (yo?)
- [ ] test
- [ ] many other best practice

## How the code is structured

- src
  - flux: action, reducers and selectors
  - route: route configurations and layouts
  - component: components (smart ones and dumb ones)
  - store: contains basic store setup and all reducers (maybe middlewares?)
